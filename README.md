# Voxel Geometry
  Voxel Geometry is the next generation of Fast Builder, which is based on Minecraft GameTest engine. A voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. Geometry means this software is very **mathematically** and owns more features as follows for generating awesome structures.
  
- **Lindenmayer system** (**L-System**) : A parallel rewriting system. The recursive nature of the L-system rules leads to self-similarity and thereby, fractal-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system.
- **Turtle Graphic** : Full features and extensions of turtle graphics.
- **Linear and Nonlinear Transforom** : Mapping space into another one. TO DO.
- **Surface generation** : TO DO.
- **Expression drawing** : TO DO.
- **Basic Geometry**
- **Markov Chains**
- **Ramdom Theory**

# Command Design
