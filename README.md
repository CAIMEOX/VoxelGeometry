# Voxel Geometry

  Voxel Geometry is the next generation of Fast Builder (Or World Edit, But focus more on Geometry) based on Minecraft Game Test engine. It is turning complete, which supports native JavaScript grammar. If you are familiar with JavaScript , you can consider Voxel Geometry as a geometric library that effects on Minecraft world.

 A voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. Geometry means this software is very **mathematically** and owns more features as follows for generating awesome structures.

- **Basic Geometry** : Sphere, circle, cylinder, torus, line and more.
- **Lindenmayer system** (**L-System**) : A parallel rewriting system. The recursive nature of the L-system rules leads to self-similarity and thereby, fractal-like forms are easy to describe with an L-system.
- **Turtle Graphic** : Full features and extensions of turtle graphics.
- **Functional Style** : Voxel Geometry includes a powerful simple JavaScript functional-programming toolset named [Pure Eval](https://github.com/PureEval/PureEval.git). This enables you to compose function together to construct more complex structure.
- **Transformer** : Transforming space into another by pipe, compose, scale, diffusion and more. 
- **Expression drawing** : Constructing from math expression.
- **Linear and Nonlinear Transform** : Mapping space into another one.
- **Markov Chains**
- **Random Theory**

## Basic Concepts

### Console



### Grammar

  Voxel Geometry supports data types like functions, arrays, numbers, strings and more. You can do everything through the combination of some basic functions.

#### Function Apply
```javascript
function(arg1, arg2, ...)
```

##### Variable

​	Define a var:
```javascript
let name = value
```

## Effect

​	Most function in Voxel Geometry is pure function (A function has no side effects), which means it **can not** do anything on Minecraft world. Only a part of function has the ability to affect the Minecraft world
